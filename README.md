# PDF.js Reader

PDF.js Reader uses an unmodified version of the [PDF.js viewer](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html) and its style matches the current VS Code theme.

In addition to viewing PDF documents, it offers annotation tools for highlighting text, adding text and drawings, and image stamps. The annotations can be saved with documents and synchronized for multiple views.
